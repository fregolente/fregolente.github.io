I am a Professor of Computer Science at Old Dominion University, where I've been on the faculty since 2006.  

For an overview of my research over the past few years, see [On the importance of web archiving](https://items.ssrc.org/parameters/on-the-importance-of-web-archiving/), an article I wrote for [*SSRC Parameters*](https://items.ssrc.org/category/parameters/) in 2018. I recently gave an [interview covering my background, our research group, and challenges facing web archive collections](https://circulatingnow.nlm.nih.gov/2022/11/10/whats-in-a-web-archive-collection-summarization-and-discovery-of-archived-webpages/) for the National Library of Medicine's [*Circulating Now* blog](https://circulatingnow.nlm.nih.gov/). I'm currently featured on the [ODU Faculty Women in STEM page](https://www.odu.edu/facultydevelopment/women-in-stem#tab9=3&done1612907281342), where you can read a bit more about my background and experiences as a woman in computer science. For more information on my education and work experience, see my [bio](#bio).

**Research Interests:** web science, social media, web archiving, digital preservation, information visualization (see some student infovis projects in  my [infovis gallery](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~mweigle/research/gallery.html))

## Graduate Program Director

I serve as the Graduate Program Director (GPD) for Administration in the Department of Computer Science.  (We also have a GPD for Admissions and a GPD for Advising.) See our website for information on our graduate programs ([Master's Program](https://odu.edu/compsci/academics/graduate/masters), [PhD Program](https://odu.edu/compsci/academics/graduate/phd)). If you need to contact a CS GPD, please use [csgpd@odu.edu](mailto:csgpd@odu.edu).

## Teaching 

This semester (Spring 2023), I am teaching [CS 725/825 - Information Visualization & Data Analytics](https://weiglemc.github.io/teaching/2023-spr-cs725825).

## Research

I'm a member of the ODU Web Science and Digital Libraries (WS-DL) Research Group.
