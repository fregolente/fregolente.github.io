Many graduate level courses assume that students are familiar with the Unix (or Linux) computing environment and have good experience programming, especially in Java, C++, and/or web languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Students are strongly encouraged to consult the syllabi for their upcoming semester’s courses to see what skills are required and to go through the corresponding materials listed below to prepare themselves before the semester begins.

## ODU-CS Computing Environment

## Writing

In many of your courses, you will be asked to write (reports, papers, summaries). Here are some resources that might be helpful.

* Resources from [ODU’s Writing Center](https://www.odu.edu/al/centers/writing-center): https://sites.wp.odu.edu/writingcenter/
* [OWL (Online Writing Lab)](https://owl.purdue.edu/), Purdue University
* [Dr. Grammar](https://web.archive.org/web/20150725234932/http://www.drgrammar.org/), University of Northern Iowa – this site is no longer available on the live web, but the link will take you to an archived version
